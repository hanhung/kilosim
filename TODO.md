- Write up bugs/issues for Mike
    - Turn direction
    - Angle wrapping
    - Fixed/improved kinematics
- Add temporal pattern detection
    - Count duration of each dark/light sequence
    - Find standard deviation of these durations (both consistent)
    - Threshold: STD *below* threshold is considered ordered
- Determining thresholds for curvature/temporal pattern?
- Confidence (dissemination duration) for curvature?
- Maybe make point_in_polygon/point_in_circle XOR so you can get concentric rings (`PATTERN_RINGS`)
- Fix: Kilobots overlap on collisions
