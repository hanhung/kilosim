- Fix bots stuck on wall
    - Shrink edge region to < 2*radius
    - If stay in gray region for long enough, change turn direction
- Why are bots passing/ghosting through dead kilobots?
- Write up bugs/issues for Mike
    - Turn direction
    - Angle wrapping
- Add pattern detection
    - Set which feature to detect (in setup or robot_init)
    - Belief about that feature (and maybe certainty)
    - Belief/certainty about overall pattern
    - Feature detection functions (including when to start/end detection)
    - Communicating info about pattern/feature (voter models?)
    - Somewhere store pattern type options (start with binary classification)
- Maybe make point_in_polygon/point_in_circle XOR so you can get concentric rings (`PATTERN_RINGS`)
- Do robots send information about their feature knowledge, pattern belief, or both?
- How do the other robots incorporate this knowledge into their beliefs?
    - No difference in pattern belief update based on own feature detection type
    - Handled by message receiving function (might call helper function)
    - Shouldn't alter feature knowledge, just pattern belief
    - Shouldn't totally adopt neighbor pattern belief, since then you wouldn't get benefit of different agent types
    - Should account for randomness involved in detection (might solve self/converge over long enough time - will have to test)
- Maybe don't make observation duration match RW straight duration (esp. for short RW)
